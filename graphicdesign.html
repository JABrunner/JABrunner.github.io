								<h2>College Sped Ad Project</h2>
								<p>My final project for my videography class at LATI</br>
								Loved the way this turned out as it took some imagination and some </br>
								creative liberties. Click the picture to take you to the video to watch it yourself</p>

								<h2>Moving into my New Apartment</h2>
								<p>After finishing up with college, I got moved into my new place.<br/>
								I was really happy to move onto the next chapter of my life<br/><br/>
								I went ahead and made a video about it to commemorate the event.<br/>
								I was super stoked about moving into Zona Rosa in Northland, Kansas City <br/>
								as it describes itself hub for the Northland area and the apartments are right
								in the middle of Zona Rosa

								<h2>Emulator Glitched Out</h2>
								<p>While attempt to do a Let's Play type video<br/>
								the emulator stopped working part way through. While trying to<br/>
								salvage what I could, I eventually had to concede and cut my losses<br/>
								and make the best out of it and I found I could just poke fun at my own expense</p>

								<h2>LATI Story Time Thumbnail</h2>
								<p>After graduating from Lake Area Tech, I wanted
									to share my experience during my time attending. Admittedly
									I share in this video that I got two Associates Degrees,this was
									in error, I received two specializations under one degree. Either way
									I spent time learning how to develop skills in computer programming
									web development and video production.

								<h2>I've Been Gone for Awhile, Here's What's Up</h2>
								<p>Not long after taking up my regular day as an Amazon Delivery Associates, I wanted
									to keep viewers up to date, on what was going on with me. Deiverying packages doesn't afford
									 me very much time to make Youtube content as Amazon had me working 10 hour days. Regardless
									 it was job that needed to be done in order to support myself to hopefully move to a career
									 in either Graphic, Game Design or Computer Programming.
