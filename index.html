								<h2>Allow me to introduce myself,before my name is Jordan<br />
								and I do graphic design although mostly programming.</h2>
								<p>In 1992, I was born to two farmers in rural Wisconsin. As young as 5 years old<br />
								I had a fascination with computers and video games. So much so I've wanted make my own.<br/>
								In sixth grade I was diagnosed with Aspergers, most look at the and think of it as a disability<br/>
								To me, it's my super power, while at a young age it kept me from being organized or kept me from<br/>
								staying focus, I learned to "gamify" thing's I do and in doing so I find solutions to problems some<br/>
								might choose to give up on. I graduated from Lake Area Technical Institute in 2020 with a degree Computer Information Systems<br/>
								In addition to programming I've also been known to dabble in some graphic design and video editting. Some<br/>
								examples down below

								<h2>Youtube Gaming Thumbnail</h2>
								<p>On my Youtube channel, I had some difficulties running the emulator that was supposed to be
								running the game I was playing, and it didn't seem to want to cooperate so I ended up
								just making the best out of it and making light of the gaffs that took place</p>
